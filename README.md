## About  
This project presents the design of a relational database system for the Dailyhunt platform. It includes diagrams and scripts reflecting schema definitions, normalization steps up to BCNF, functional dependencies, and sample SQL queries.

## Project Structure  
| File Name                   | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `ER Diagram.png`            | Entity-Relationship Diagram |
| `Relational Schema.pdf`     | Schema representation from ER model |
| `DDL Script.pdf`            | SQL DDL statements for table creation |
| `MinimalFDs.pdf`            | Set of minimal functional dependencies |
| `Normalization_to_BCNF.pdf` | Step-by-step normalization to BCNF |
| `Data_Insertion.txt`        | Sample data insertion scripts |
| `Queries.pdf`               | Example SQL queries on the schema |

## ER Diagram  
Open the `ER Diagram.png` to visualize the entities and relationships forming the backbone of the database design.

## Database Schema & Normalization  
Refer to `Relational Schema.pdf` for how the database structure is derived from the ER diagram, and `Normalization_to_BCNF.pdf` for the normalization workflow, ensuring minimal redundancy.

## Setting Up the Database  
1. Open DDL script in `DDL Script.pdf` and execute it in your SQL environment.
2. Run the sample insert statements from `Data_Insertion.txt` to populate the tables.
3. Use `Queries.pdf` to test queries against your setup.

## Sample Queries  
Explore SQL examples in `Queries.pdf`. These demonstrate retrieving insights like:
- Listing top news by date.
- Fetching user or category-specific content.

## Functional Dependencies  
View `MinimalFDs.pdf` to understand key dependencies and their implications on your design.

## Normalization Process  
Step by step normalization logic is described in `Normalization_to_BCNF.pdf`, showing how each schema evolves toward BCNF compliance.
