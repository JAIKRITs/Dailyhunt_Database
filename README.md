## � About  
This project presents the design of a relational database system for the Dailyhunt platform. It includes diagrams and scripts reflecting schema definitions, normalization steps up to BCNF, functional dependencies, and sample SQL queries.

---

## 📊 ER Diagram  
Open the `ER Diagram.png` to visualize the entities and relationships forming the backbone of the database design.

---

## 🏗️ Database Schema & Normalization  
Refer to:
- `Relational Schema.pdf` for database structure derived from ER diagram  
- `Normalization_to_BCNF.pdf` for normalization workflow (minimal redundancy)  

---

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Database  
1. Execute DDL script from `DDL Script.pdf` in your SQL environment  
2. Run sample inserts from `Data_Insertion.txt` to populate tables  
3. Test queries from `Queries.pdf`  

---

## 🔍 Sample Queries  
Explore SQL examples in `Queries.pdf` demonstrating:
- 📅 Listing top news by date  
- 👥 Fetching user/category-specific content  

---

## 🔑 Functional Dependencies  
View `MinimalFDs.pdf` to understand key dependencies and design implications.

---

## 🔄 Normalization Process  
Step-by-step normalization logic in `Normalization_to_BCNF.pdf` showing evolution to BCNF compliance.
